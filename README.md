# tabWithAccordion
1)Build customized tabs functionality in a page. There should be minimum three tabs (By default third tab should be hidden). 2)In first tab there should be a checkbox with text “Show Price-Breakup”(By default it is unchecked). If it is checked, it should display/show the third tab. If the checkbox is unchecked, it should hide the third tab. 3)In second tab there should be Accordion with fully animated open and close actions. It should have support for groups/subitems. There should be images too.
